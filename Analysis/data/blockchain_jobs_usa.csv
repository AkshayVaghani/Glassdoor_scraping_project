The Director will oversee a team of Engineers and Engineering Managers and will have a significant impact on the future growth and direction of the business.We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of responsibilities. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframeHow to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at itBit. So, we have taken the Operating System of itBit - our values - and made it relevant to this role.

Success is measured by the delivery of high quality, highly available, scalable and secure systems that can achieve set business metrics. Collaborate with internal and external stakeholders to define and deliver the technical vision for the platform. Success is measured by the ability to surface intelligent insights on platform performance and engagement that lead to key decisions on the future of the platform, our ability to serve clients/customers etc. Strategically balance immediate vs. long-term product work by making thoughtful decisions on accumulating technical debt vs. longer term development.

How to achieve the OutcomesFunctional acumen required: Have a strong technical background and spend some of their time researching new technologies and staying abreast of trends in the tech industry. Capable of jumping in to help debug and triage critical systems, and should understand the systems they oversee well enough to perform code reviews and help research problems as needed. Contribute to the architecture and design efforts primarily by serving as the technically-savvy voice that asks business and product questions of the engineers on their teams, ensuring that the code matches the business needs and can scale appropriately as those needs grow.Shared commitment to excellence: Have a very high bar for the product as it impacts the end customer/client and relentlessly advocate for a infrastructural approach to solve persistent problems.

Recognize, celebrate and reward high impact work.Real time candor: Do not hesitate to voice engineering truths at the right time, in front of the right audience, while making product or client facing decisions that affect the long term viability of the business or the itBit product. Doing so in a way that leads to a better solution is paramount, even if it is inconvenient for others in the moment. Build strong trust with cross-functional partners, particularly in product and the business, by disagreeing with them in an open way when required, but working in earnest to activate a decision that has been made even if it goes against what you wanted to do. Desired Experience A strong engineering background with progressive growth in role scope that has led to managing multiple engineering teams.

Gartner forecasts the business value of blockchain at $176B by 2025 and $3.1T by 2030. The disruption caused by blockchain threatens the status-quo of multiple industries and the dustup that follows will pivot core transactional systems to new rails for the next 25 years. This technology has the potential to transform the relationships between businesses, governments, and individuals in society. Blockchain offers a model for secure, multi-party computation that unlocks new transactional and collaboration models across organizations.  We believe that cloud technology can empower people and businesses around the world to achieve more, and we see blockchain as a strong complement to Microsoft’s existing assets. We are positioned to lead across the spectrum of innovation at the edge that blockchain demands: new math, hardware, platform services, partnerships, competencies, consortiums, market designs, economic models and regulations. The challenges in these areas are substantial – it is not easy for industries to pivot to new networks based on fledgling technology. We are working to bring lighthouse customers to production, and then to reapply the compelling product portfolio that results to accelerate early adopters more broadly.ResponsibilitiesIn this role, you will build our blockchain product offering for the enterprise. You will rapidly and iteratively create customer value. You will build offerings that meet customer needs today, with the capability to scale to tomorrow’s needs. You will collaborate across boundaries with your peers and sister teams to integrate multiparty workflows through APIs and other interfaces.  The product offering consists of a full stack of components from infrastructure to PaaS and SaaS: Azure Blockchain Workbench enables enterprises to rapidly design and spin up blockchain-enabled workflows integrated with Azure services that allow users to walk through those workflows across counterparties and roles. Integrating AAD SSO, KeyVault for key management, PowerBI for data visualization, Azure Websites for presentation, IoT for device integration, Xamarin for mobile apps, and more; AppBuilder takes the complexity out of building apps around blockchain, enabling partners and innovators to get to market faster, with more confidence in the value they are creating.Enterprise Smart Contracts abstracts business rules from the blockchain, enabling customers to write secure, scalable, portable business logic that automatically integrates with multiple blockchains. This Azure PaaS service acts as the application layer in an enterprise architecture, extending the reach of blockchain to existing enterprise developers using the programming models of their choice. It also models the concept of a consortium of counterparties who can securely transact with each other, without requiring universal trust or a centralized database.Managed Ledger extends Azure Marketplace blockchain offerings to deliver the top enterprise ledger technologies in the industry in an easily-consumed package in Azure and Azure Stack so that enterprises can focus on building applications, rather than deploying and managing blockchain infrastructure.Coco Framework integrates Trusted Execution Environments such as Intel SGX into blockchain networks to enable enterprise-grade scalability, latency, fine-grained confidentiality and network governance. This framework will be delivered in 2018 as a disruptive open-source offering on both Windows and Linux, incorporating new technology from MSR and Azure, with committed partners eagerly waiting to integrate it. The product portfolio will consist of multiple layers in the stack, some built from scratch as open source, others built as proprietary extensions to Microsoft’s existing platforms.

We seek an experienced developer with experience building enterprise services in a collaborative team environment. Prior experience with security, distributed systems and cloud services is appreciated. We seek candidates who enjoy learning and experimenting, and who are passionate about meeting customer needs.

Its flagship service is BankchainTM, a next-generation blockchain settlement platform that is transforming post-trade across capital markets. Paxos management team is led by CEO and Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla and its board of directors includes former FDIC chair Sheila Bair, former Senator Bill Bradley, former chair of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Robert Herz, former chairman, president & CEO of Lotus Development Corporation Jim Manzi and former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer. We are looking for a Manager for our IT Infrastructure to improve our existing IT foundation, and build it for scale. We are a high growth company and we want to make sure that we have the necessary equipment and systems to pursue the opportunities in front of us. A seamless environment where all employees equipment needs and experiences are exceptional is what we strive for. This is a role that has the possibility to earn more responsibility within the organization depending on performance. Efficiency and quality of work should be the most important attributes for aspiring candidates as well as deep IT acumen.We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of responsibilities. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframe.How to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at Paxos. So, we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role. Outcomes: Design and manage a comprehensive IT infrastructure that includes laptops, phones and other hardware that meets the needs of Paxos regulators, employees and other stakeholders. Success is measured by the ability of the program to provide a seamless technology and equipment experience for all, manage appropriate issues and resolve them quickly, communicate timely and effectively with all staff, and elevate any issues to the appropriate manager. Create a process that provides a clear way for employees to understand, interact and adhere to IT policy and procedures. Success is measured by the ability to to provide a seamless IT experience for all employees while maintaining proper controls, permissions and procedures. Identify and manage a team of external and internal resources that can encompass a world class IT system. The resources (employees and contractors) should provide coverage of all systems including the development of new processes, inventory management, office equipment, AV, and any specific employee IT needs.Capacity management: primary goal of the IT Manager will be to ensure that IT resources are right-sized to meet current and future business requirements in a cost-effective manner. Success is measured by surfacing / communicating changes necessary to improve the infrastructure on a regular basis, and then work with business leaders to understand what systems they are using in order to better optimize bandwidth and system control.How to achieve the Outcomes:Functional Acumen: Deep knowledge of equipment needs for technology companies as their needs evolve and develop. The right person for the role will be able to anticipate what will be needed by the business in terms of computers, AV, printing, applications etc. A successful candidate is someone who has worked for a technology company and understands the pace and needs of these businesses. Research and the pursuit of new methods and technologies that could be beneficial to the business in the medium and short-term will be absolutely critical to success.Shared Commitment to Excellence: A successful IT Manager will hold herself/himself to the same high standard that is expected from the business. An example of this would be an IT Manager perhaps not satisfying an employee request immediately because it does not fit within the work standards developed by a successful IT team. The right IT Manager would make sure that the request is addressed, but would push back to find a solution that meets the high standards of the company.Search for the Truth: Truth and honesty will be especially important for this role. There are lots of moving parts, and a significant amount of equipment to manage. Only an IT Manager that is constantly searching for the right solutions will be successful. If a candidates attitude is if something isnt broke, dont fix it that will not be an acceptable mindset because we want our IT department to be on the cutting edge of workplace technology and efficiency. If there are steps to be taken that will require more work, but are ultimately important for the business, the IT department should take the initiative to make changes and keep finding the BEST for Paxos.Real Time Candor: In the IT role, the ability to say NO (politely) is extremely important. They sit at the cross section of a lot of different teams and conversations, and it is very easy to just say YES and move on. However, candid feedback and explanations to teams / business leaders will go a long way in making sure IT is effective. Also, if someone demands a process, system or piece of equipment, the IT Manager should be able to determine its necessity and effectively communicate his or her opinion in a way that is respectful. Being able to surface an issue with a stakeholder before it becomes escalated, and doing the necessary work before to understand and communicate.Be an owner: As we continue to increase our headcount, office footprint and client base, the need to try new things, own the process, and prioritize effectively will be critical. As the responsibilities of the role increase, it will be important for the IT Manager to be a self starter who proactively finds solutions, rather than wait for their manager to tell them to do things. It will make the role function at a higher level if potential problems are thought about in advance, rather than constantly putting out fires and reacting to issues as they come up. Also important will be the ability to anticipate what the company will need, and the foresight to start having conversations early in the process so that enough time is left for planning and execution. Time and speed are always critical in a business like ours. Every issue should be answered and dealt with in a timely manner from all levels of the company (Chad especially). If someone has to wait or there is a backlog, it will be up to the IT Manager to effectively communicate timing and get back to the employee as soon as possible. Expectations must be properly set, and we want our IT Manager to always have a sense of urgency, but do their job in a way that promotes a sense of calm and trust. A great IT Manager will inherently know what is most urgent, how to prioritize tasks and make it unnoticeable to employees.Desired Experiences: Experience designing and implementing an IT Helpdesk program at scale in a Mac environment Strong experience in assessing and negotiating technology solutions from external vendors and 3rd parties and successfully integrating with the company network Strong experience in proactively assessing for network capacity issues and recommending solutions before they become an issue Read moreSee All",IT Manager, 9 days ago

,"New York, NY",230523,"[('Headquarters', 'New York, NY'), ('Size', '10000+ employees'), ('Founded', 'Unknown'), ('Type', 'Nonprofit Organization'), ('Industry', 'Government'), ('Revenue', 'Unknown / Non-Applicable per year'), ('Competitors', 'Unknown')]",UNDP,3.9,United States,"BackgroundOpportunities provided to youth will define the future of most developing countries. Today’s generation of young people is close to 1.8 billion – more than at any other time in history. Approximately 90% of them live in developing countries. With over half of the world under the age of 30, young people are crucial for the success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The issue of youth unemployment is seen as an urgent task and unlike the most targets, its deadline is set for 2020. In Europe and the CIS, substantial progress has been made towards political stability, consolidation of democracy, rule of law, and improvement of human rights records. However, despite the progress, many issues need to be addressed: after a period of relative stability, indicators of democratic governance in the region have recently shown declines in many countries.  The Istanbul Regional Hub (IRH) is UNDP’s main knowledge and advisory hub for the countries serviced by UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Europe and CIS (RBEC). In the region, UNDP works with national and international partners to strengthen the social contract between the state and society in a manner that protects human rights, promotes equality, and enhances social cohesion. The Hub also connects the region to a global network of development experts, to build knowledge and capacity, and to forge partnerships to meet the development challenges of a large and diverse region. The Hub implements the Regional Programme (2018-2021) that has been formulated based on the most crucial regional challenges in the region with a particular focus on a strengthened approach to specific sub-regional challenges.  Furthermore, the Istanbul Regional Hub is also implementing sub-regional initiatives and projects, such as the Transformative Governance and Finance Facility (TGFF), which empowers young people through the use of new data and new technologies in the region. TGFF seeks to utilize new technologies, data and alternative finance mechanisms in support of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), through three outputs: new technologies, data and engagement of citizens are used to improve governance and development outcomes; collaborative platforms are utilized at the regional and national level to drive innovative solutions to governance and development challenges; and effectiveness of development interventions is strengthened and enhanced through alternative finance mechanisms.  Through TGFF, the Slovak Ministry of Finance and UNDP have embarked on regional approaches to empowering young people through the use of new data and new technologies. Through networked innovation, exploration of data and new technologies, futures thinking and access to tools, knowledge and skills, young people in the Black Sea (Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) and the Western Balkans regions are connecting, innovating, and solving problems to improve their lives, while also expanding their skills in diverse areas. Ministry of Data (http://www.ministryofdata.info/) is a flagship regional open data challenge within TGFF. As of now, there have been 3 rounds of the Ministry of Data, two in the Western Balkans, and one in the Black Sea region. Ministry of Data has reached around 1000 young people through meet-ups in 13 countries, solicited 150 ideas from over 600 young people and brought together 150 young people to look at issues as diverse as air pollution, transparency, mobility and gender empowerment, generating solutions. Through the Ministry of Data, UNDP has worked with over 40 mentors, engaged the private sector and supported the development of 8 ideas. Ministry of Data acts as a catalyser, convener and a source of expertise. Its objective is to be the platform which promotes the use of cutting-edge technologies in a people-centred way – including artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain technologies – in addressing issues that affect the daily life of citizens.  With these general parameters in mind, UNDP is seeking a consultant to redesign the next phase of the Ministry of Data challenge. The new phase will build on the lessons learned from the past three rounds, and will focus on addressing the barriers commonly faced by innovators: providing access to funding, understanding user demand, experience in leadership, generating metrics to prove that the solution works, support in navigating the policy environment, development of a viable business plan and acceleration support. Due to the good experience during the latest challenge in Georgia, and for the benefit of continuity, the project will continue working in Georgia as the seat of the challenge for the next 3 years. This will have positive spill-over effects in terms of strengthening the data eco-systems and supporting organic community engagement. Duties and ResponsibilitiesThe consultant will be home-based and will work under the direct supervision of the TGFF Project Manager to support the design and implementation of Ministry of Data activities within TGFF. Given the nature of the tasks requiring close cooperation with the TGFF Project Manager and other partners, travel to Istanbul, Turkey, will be envisioned (2 times during the assignment) and to Tbilisi, Georgia (once during the assignment). The project implementation is expected to take place in close partnership with UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub, relevant UNDP country offices, partners and national counterparts.

Are you passionate about learning and open minded about the way that networks are built? Do you have a passion for organizing and visualizing data to aid in the understanding and development of network systems? Consider spending your summer with the research and development team for Berkeley Lab’s Scientific Networking Division. We’re a dynamic organization, highly-motivated and focused on results. Our mission: to accelerate science by delivering unparalleled networking capabilities, tools, and innovations. As an organization, we are small enough to be agile, but large enough to offer rewarding challenges on a global scale. At the core of the Scientific Networking Division is ESnet, the Energy Sciences Network. ESnet interconnects the US national laboratory system, is widely-regarded as a technical pioneer, and is currently the fastest science network in the world. We are working at the leading edge of software-defined networking, OpenFlow, dynamic network infrastructure, network visualization, network knowledge plane, multi-domain and multi-layer architectures. The successful student will be the one that brings strong and diverse coding skills and is very self motivated. ESnet Summer Student ProjectsProject Title: Advancing the concepts designed in INDIRA to recognize and handle user intents for scientific workflowsRequired skills: Python; Java Skills desired: JavaScript, ontology design (such as using Jython to interface Java/Python libraries), visual designAbstract: Scientific workflows and the services they interact with have multiple network requirements. In our preliminary work, we found that there is a difference between user intent and application intent, when it comes to specify how the network should behave at desired requests. Using OWL ontologies and rule based reasoning, INDIRA focused on conversing with users as a means to gather requirements which are then automatically converted to network programming commands. In this next project phase, we want to push INDIRA to a more application intent gatherer which can demonstrate network interaction and configuration. We aim to advance the ontology previously created (using NML, TOSCA, etc) and automate building of network models which can then be demonstrated either on mininet or the ESnet testbed for particular science applications. The aim is to push INDIRA to an installable code for network intent.––––––––––Project Title: Implementing smart contracts for scientific workflowsRequired skills: Python; desired programming skills, possibly java, solidity, some understanding of smart contractsAbstract: Blockchains are being explored as the next best way of sharing information and keeping it secure. With the added boom of cryptocurrency the topic is gathering a lot of interest from all science applications. This project aims to explore how blockchains can be used to (a) enhance scientific workflows (b) improve compute for machine learning applications. With (a) we envision blockchains can allow security authentication practices across multiple network domains to be made easy. With (b) we envision that blockchains can allow a method to securely gather machine learning models from different parts of the network and send securely communicate data across them. This is an exploratory project, allowing the student to develop new ideas and demonstrate them via code to demonstrate this. The goal is to improve how scientific workflows across the complex network can be enhanced in performance keeping security at highest priority. The student will be required to produce code which is installable at different network locations to proof concepts.––––––––––Project Title: Network and Security Monitoring and Management (1 opening)Required skills: Basic networking knowledge, scripting with python/perl, and linux administration.Abstract: ESnet is constantly pushing the limits of networking technology and the ability to automate, secure, manage, and support cutting edge technologies. This position will work with a variety of ESnet technical staff to enhance and automate aspects of ESnet’s capacity planning process, network monitoring, and configuration management. The student will do programming and analysis facilitating the following deliverables:Automate the creation of some additional link utilization graphs to facilitate analysis (for better understanding utilization burstiness).Automate generation of reports & graphs, so that they can be generated/used on a ad-hoc or monthly basis instead of the current quarterly cadence.Potentially re-write/transform the current statistics analysis process to use the new data backend for accessing the raw SNMP dataParticipate in the design and implementation of the current ESnet traffic matrice with PMACCT Some programming skills are required and a basic understanding of network protocols (UDP, TCP/IP, HTTP) would be extremely beneficial.This is a great opportunity for a student to get their hands dirty looking closely at network device configurations and packet flows. ––––––––––Project Title: iperf3Project Mentor: Bruce Mah / Jon DuganRequired skills: C programming language, UNIX network programming experience, software engineering and testing experience desiredAbstract: iperf3 is the current version of ESnet’s open-source bandwidth and performance testing application. It is used as a component of the perfSONAR performance measurement system, as a standalone application, and embedded in some other third-party applications. This project consists of implementing a number of enhancements to iperf3, for example (but not limited to): an improved test framework to detect bugs and regressions, expanded TCP statistics, multithreading support, various usability and feature improvements, augmenting the iperf3 library interfaces used for integration into third-party code, or improving documentation of iperf3 internals. This work will become a part of future iperf3 releases, some which may take place during the timespan of this project.How to Apply Students interested in the program must apply on line.

Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.About This RoleOver the past few years, we’ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well. We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.What You’ll Be Working OnVery is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science & machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.  At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.  You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.  Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.  We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:  • React & React Native Swift & Objective CElixir, Phoenix, and NervesArduino (embedded C/C++)Ethereum / SolidityRuby on RailsPythonPandasServerlessAWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)  Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.How To ApplyThis is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!  To apply, please send us a note to jobs@verypossible.com with ""Senior JavaScript Engineer"" in the subject line. Please include the following:What’s most important to you from a company culture and operating environment?What are the biggest things that de-motivate you and make you unhappy when it comes to being an engineer working on teams within a company?Your resumeCode samples with comments explaining what you did and how you architected the code. About UsNot to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.Why Work at Very?The health, happiness, and long-term career growth of our team is a top priority. What does that mean in practice? We pay for gym memberships and give generous parental leave. We match 401k contributions up to 2% of your salary and reserve 35% of the company’s ownership for a team member options pool. Each employee gets a professional development stipend to use on conference registration, continuing education, professional memberships, etc... We're a remote-first company, so you can work where you want (in a hammock on the beach, anyone?).  But a healthy company culture isn't just about perks. It's about creating an environment where our employees can lead fulfilling lives, both at work and at home. Working overtime for extended periods indicates a fundamental failure in planning or communication. If this happens at Very, it’s a sign that something needs to be reevaluated and corrected. If you’re looking around wondering why people aren’t in “crunch mode,” the answer’s pretty simple. The thing we work hardest at is hiring good people, so we want them to stick around and have a good balance between work and the rest of the important stuff in life.How You’ll Be CompensatedWe believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC — prices and plans vary based on your region — as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.We Fully Embrace Working RemotelyAbout 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.How We OperateWe are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.

Its flagship service is BankchainTM, a next-generation blockchain settlement platform that is transforming post-trade across capital markets. Paxos management team is led by CEO and Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla and its board of directors includes former FDIC chair Sheila Bair, former Senator Bill Bradley, former chair of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Robert Herz, former chairman, president & CEO of Lotus Development Corporation Jim Manzi and former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer. We are looking for a Director of Engineering for our Bankchain Infrastructure engineering team. The Bankchain Infrastructure engineering team includes Core Platform Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering and Test Engineering teams. The Director will oversee a team of Engineers and Engineering Managers and will have a significant impact on the future direction and delivery of Bankchain infrastructure to our customers. Bankchain infrastructure includes the core Distributed Ledger Technology platform underpinning Bankchain Precious Metals and Bankchain Securities settlement products.We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of responsibilities. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframeHow to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at itBit. So, we have taken the Operating System of itBit - our values - and made it relevant to this role. Outcomes: Guide and coach a team of engineers and engineering leaders to design and build out Bankchain infrastructure which includes the core Distributed Ledger Technology Platform. Success is measured by the delivery of high quality, highly available, scalable and secure systems that can achieve set business metrics. Collaborate with internal and external stakeholders to define and deliver the technical vision for the DLT platform. Success is measured by the ability to surface intelligent insights on features and customer problems that lead to key decisions on the future of the platform and our ability to serve clients/customers. Strategically balance immediate vs. long-term infrastructure work by making thoughtful decisions on accumulating technical debt vs. longer term development. Success is measured by the right balance between feature completeness, polish and time-to-market to meet business outcomes. Build and develop a world-class engineering team. Success is defined by constantly giving timely feedback, rewarding and growing the best engineers and leaders, investing in development of leaders as well as quick/swift action on poor performance.How to achieve the Outcomes:Functional acumen required: Have a strong technical background and spend some of their time researching new technologies in the blockchain and reliability engineering space and stay abreast of trends in infrastructure engineering. Capable of jumping in to help debug and triage critical systems, and should understand the systems they oversee well enough to perform code reviews and help research problems as needed. Contribute to the architecture and design efforts primarily by serving as the technically-savvy voice that asks business and product questions of the engineers on their teams, ensuring that the code matches the business needs and can scale appropriately as those needs grow.Shared commitment to excellence: Have a very high bar for the platform as it impacts the end customer/client and relentlessly advocate for a infrastructural approach to solve persistent problems. Coach and develop your entire organization to hold the same bar in their interaction with cross-functional stakeholders. Partner with academia, visionaries and other external luminaries in the Distributed Ledger Technology space to come up with innovative ideas that give Bankchain Platform a significant advantage. This will involve coming up with new products that we may be able to launch to solve interesting problems in the financial technology space. Advocate for Paxos as a company of choice to potential candidates. Inspire potential recruits to join the company.Search for the truth: Be able to translate high level business goals for Paxos into a strategic operating plan for the Bankchain Infrastructure engineering teams. This includes a plan to translate high level business goals into key objectives, milestones and results for every member of the team as well as develop a strong resourcing plan to meet those goals. Navigate a highly ambiguous and complex engineering infrastructure for Paxos between the Precious Metals and Securities products and make effective trade-offs between experiments to find product market fit versus long-term strategic build.Be an owner: Strong communicator and can simplify technical concepts in a way to explain them to non-technical partners, and take business direction and explain it to the technology team in a way that inspires and guides them. Leverage past experience and use strong communication skills to collaborate effectively with all stakeholders including customers, senior management and other business leaders. Demonstrate care for team members by showing a good understanding of the experiences that matter the most to each team member and leader during their time at itBit. Recognize, celebrate and reward high impact work.Real time candor: Do not hesitate to voice engineering truths at the right time, in front of the right audience, while making infrastructure decisions that affect the long term viability of the business or the Bankchain products. Doing so in a way that leads to a better solution is paramount, even if it is inconvenient for others in the moment. Build strong trust with cross-functional partners, particularly in product and the business, by disagreeing with them in an open way when required, but working in earnest to activate a decision that has been made even if it goes against what you wanted to do.Desired Experience: A strong engineering background with progressive growth in role scope that has led to managing multiple engineering teams. Strong background in Distributed Systems/Blockchain/Cryptography/Security space. Startup experience is a huge plus. Experience in strategic decision making optimizing for product market fit in the short-term while having a long-term vision of building a strong technology platform.

In fiscal year 2015, the WBG committed $60 billion in loans, grants, equity investments and guarantees to its members and private businesses, of which $19 billion was concessional finance to its poorest members. It is governed by 188-member countries and delivers services out of 120 offices with nearly 15,000 staff located globally.  The WBG consists of five specialized institutions: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  The global development community is at an auspicious turning point in history. Thanks to the success of the past few decades and favorable economic growth, developing countries now have an unprecedented opportunity to end extreme poverty within a generation. This is the vision of the WBG: to eradicate extreme poverty by reducing the number of people living on less than $1.90 a day to 3 percent by 2030, and promote shared prosperity by fostering the income growth of the bottom 40 percent in every country.  To achieve this vision, the WBG Board of Governors approved a strategy for the organization in 2013. This strategy leverages, for the first time, the combined strength of the WBG institutions and their unique ability to partner with the public and private sectors to deliver customized development solutions backed by finance, world class knowledge and convening services. The strategy has three components: (1) maximizing development impact by engaging country clients in identifying and tackling the most difficult development challenges; (2) promoting scaled-up partnerships that are strategically aligned with the goals; and (3) crowding in public and private resources, expertise and ideas.  The architecture underpinning the strategy and instrumental to its success is an operating model introduced in July 2014 based on fourteen Global Practices (GPs) five Cross-Cutting Solution Areas (CCSAs). Since July 1, 2015 these 14 GPs are organized under 3 Practice Group Vice Presidencies: Sustainable Development (SD); Economics, Finance and Institutions (EFI); and Human Development (HD). THE ROLE OF THE GLOBAL PRACTICE FOR FINANCE, COMPETITIVENESS AND INNOVATION (FCI) IN THE WBG As of January 1, 2018, EFI created the Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation (FCI) Global Practice, bringing together Finance and Markets (F&M) and Trade and Competitiveness’ (T&C’s) private sector development specialists. FCI is comprised of about 700 staff working across more than 120 countries. The goal of the new Global Practice is to capitalize on the synergies between F&M and T&C in fostering private-sector led growth. It aims to work toward creating an enabling environment in which financial stability, efficiency, and firm-level solutions are provided in an integrated way to crowd in the private sector, support the creation of markets, and accelerate equitable growth. FCI also houses the IFC Implementation Units focused on implementing public sector advisory work in support of the finance and entrepreneurship agenda across all six regions.  About one third of FCI professional staff are decentralized to the field working closely with the CMUs and in proximity to clients. FCI professionals also lead or participate in a wide variety of ASA and client advisory work that add to the core expertise delivered to client countries. Knowledge and learning is a central part of the FCI agenda, with work focused on the following thematic areas: (a) Financial Stability and Integrity; (b) Long Term Finance; (c) Financial Inclusion and Infrastructure; (d) Industry Solutions; (e) Firm Capabilities and Innovation; and (f) Climate and Risk Management. FCI will work closely with the other newly formed Global Practice for Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment (MTI) on systematic country diagnostics, country strategies, policy lending and other private sector diagnostics, ASA and lending activities.  The Financial Inclusion, Infrastructure and Access unit in the FCI Global Practice sits within the Financial Inclusion, Infrastructure and Access Global Practice (FCI GFCFI) that works on a range of areas including, insolvency secured transactions, credit reporting, digital finance, financial inclusion, and financial consumer protection.  Within the Financial Inclusion, Infrastructure and Access Global Practice, the Responsible Financial Access Team (RFA Team) assists national authorities to improve the policy, legal, regulatory, supervisory, and institutional framework for improving financial access and inclusion, while ensuring that consumers are adequately protected through the implementation of financial consumer protection measures and financially capable. The RFA Team provides technical inputs (including as technical project leads) to region-led advisory/analytical operations and lending operations and conducts country-level surveys and diagnostics on topics such as: national financial inclusion strategies, financial inclusion data infrastructure, regulation and supervision of non-bank deposit taking institutions, agent based delivery models, risk-based KYC, leveraging digital means for financial inclusion, financial consumer protection, regulation and supervision, alternative dispute resolution, addressing the role of gender in access to finance and financial capability. The RFA Team members also participate in flagship FCI Diagnostics such as Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) covering financial inclusion topics.  To implement these activities, the RFA Team has developed global knowledge product, guidance, and diagnostic toolkits, including: The Good Practices for Financial Consumer Protection, the FSAP Guidance Note for Financial Inclusion, Financial Inclusion Strategies Reference Framework, the Financial Inclusion Strategies resource center, a Financial Capability demand-side diagnostic tool, and a toolkit on the evaluation of financial capability enhancing programs. The RFA team also engages selectively with key international bodies working in financial inclusion and financial consumer protection.  The Financial Sector Specialist would be a core member of the RFA Team but would also work closely with the Payment System Development Group given cross-overs and synergies and would report to the Practice Manager for the Financial Inclusion, Infrastructure and Access. The Specialist sought would complement the team in the area of digital finance and financial innovation, including products and technologies such as mobile banking, blockchain and big data analytics. The Specialist should have experience with the regulatory and legal basis for digital finance / financial innovation and financial inclusion and consumer protection, obtained during time spent in a regulatory authority, working in the private sector and/or advising governments / regulators.

Our first step toward making this a reality is to reinvent title insurance.  Here is why.We are unlocking anenormousbusinessopportunity. American homeowners spent $14.3 billion on title insurance in 2016. Less than 5% of that money went back into their pockets in the form of payments on claims. Instead, nearly all of it funded a slow, inefficient, and manual research process most comparable to a librarian searching a card catalog.  We don't see card catalogs at libraries anymore, and we believe we've found a way to offer homeowners, brokers, and mortgage bankers better service at lower prices, without requiring mass-scale adoption of nascent technologies like blockchain. We are making a genuine, real-world impact on the lives of millions of Americans. Homeownership is broken, and we are doing our part to fix it. When most Americans sell the most valuable asset they will own in their lives - their home - they often lose a full 10% of its value to the fees and frictions that exist in today's real estate market. Additionally, the lengthy, bewildering, and unpredictable process incurs an emotional and stressful toll on first-time and experienced homeowners alike.  By simplifying and expediting services like title insurance, we can make the dream of homeownership more attainable and less risky, and we can help current and future homeowners save time and money that they can better invest into more meaningful parts of their lives. This is a hard and interesting problem to solve. Our approach requires contemporary machine learning, completely original risk management methodologies, flexible and adaptable data ontologies, dozens of technical integrations, and the artistic ability to simplify all that complexity to win enthusiastic adoption by a set of stakeholders otherwise unaccustomed to large, dramatic changes.  Our innovative solution has still more to prove, but once we gain traction it will take a lot to catch up to us.

UNICEF's Office of Innovation creates opportunities for the world's children by focusing on where new markets can meet their vital needs. We do this by:  Connecting youth communities (or more broadly - anyone disconnected or under-served) to decision-makers, and to each other, to deliver informed, relevant and sustained programmes that build better, stronger futures for children.  Provoking change for children through an entrepreneurial approach - in a traditionally risk-averse field - to harness rapidly moving innovations and apply them to serve the needs of all children.  Creating new models of partnership that leverage core business values across the public, private and academic sectors in order to deliver fast, and lasting results for children.  The Office of Innovation specifically looks to form partnerships around frontier technologies (like drones and UAVs, blockchain, 21st century skills, urban technologies, new banking tools, wearables and sensors, or 3D-Printing) that exist at the intersection of $100 billion business markets and 1 billion person needs - and to identify how they can grow and scale profitably and inclusively.

After nearly four years of operation, we’re making money and have a staff of 26 in San Francisco, New York and Hong Kong. Now we’re planning a multimillion-dollar investment to significantly expand our coverage into several new industries, including entertainment, fintech and crypto currencies, energy tech and biotech.  We’re looking for about a dozen additional reporters and an additional editor. We’re planning to open an office in Los Angeles for a team of entertainment reporters, to expand our New York office for a team of financial technology reporters and to hire reporters in Washington, D.C., to cover the regulatory and political worlds. Other positions could be in any location, depending on the candidate and the requirements of the role.  If you’re tired of rewriting press releases and want to set the agenda for coverage of these industries, The Information is for you. We don’t publish commodity news—just original reporting that can’t be found elsewhere. That means our reporters have the time to do in-depth stories that can make an impact, such as our exposure of venture capitalist Justin Caldbeck’s sexual harassment of female entrepreneurs, which triggered a cascade of stories about sexual harassment in Silicon Valley.  For all these positions, we want people who can both break news and write in-depth features.  We have excellent benefits, including company-paid health coverage for employees and their dependents, a generous parental leave policy for new parents, a 401(k) program, three weeks of paid leave every year to start, a gym and fitness stipend and a highly professional, inclusive, diverse workplace.  If you’re interested, email jobs@theinformation.com.  Here are the jobs (and check back for more in coming months): Hollywood: Reporting on the film and television industries today is as much about what Netflix, Apple and Amazon are up to as it is about the traditional Hollywood studios. That creates huge opportunities for stories about how the industry is evolving and how both old and new are adapting. Our focus is on the business of the movie and television industries: how traditional studios are adapting to new forms of distribution and how new players are making their mark. We’re looking to build a team of reporters to write those stories, from both the television and the film side. Candidates should have experience covering entertainment. Fintech/Cryptocurrency: Technology and finance have a lot in common. They are both opaque, confusing, misunderstood and the lifeblood of business. Increasingly they are converging, causing massive disruption to the financial system. We’re looking to hire reporters to write must-read stories about the growing number of companies at the intersection of finance and tech, from payment and blockchain startups to companies with new approaches to algorithmic trading and wealth management. We also want to track the role that the big consumer platforms (Apple, Google, Facebook, Paypal) play in the payments system. How will banking change? What happens to credit? What happens to business models? What happens to the economy? How do markets react? Telecom/media beat: As AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner and Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo and AOL demonstrate, the telecom-media industries have converged. And more upheaval is on the horizon. Verizon and AT&T are both losing subscribers to a rejuvenated T-Mobile, while cable operators Comcast and Charter have teamed up on wireless. Meanwhile, 5G technology is being tested by major carriers, opening up more opportunities in the Internet of Things devices. The Information’s telecom-media reporter will be responsible for both breaking news and writing in-depth features on these fast-developing industries. Candidates should have experience in covering either telecom or media. Facebook/Alphabet: More than any other companies, Facebook and Alphabet are changing the face of the internet. From driving advances in artificial intelligence to cornering the market for digital advertising, the two are the most important companies in Silicon Valley. They also have become a lightning rod for criticism from politicians and others concerned about tech’s dominance of everyday life. The Information is looking for an enterprising reporter to join our team and cover the two companies. Both companies have their tentacles in a variety of industries aside from their core businesses, ranging from self-driving cars to messaging services to video, health care and the future of cities. This will be a crucial job in years to come as the question increasingly is asked: Are Facebook and Alphabet too powerful? Asia: China, India and South East Asia rival the U.S. for the number of unicorns and new tech innovation. Chinese domestic giants like Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu are locked in grueling battle at home while also expanding overseas. Meanwhile, foreign multinationals like Google and Facebook keep looking for ways into China even as they compete with them in new markets like India, and South East Asia where homegrown rivals Grab and Flipkart raise billions of dollars. The Information is looking for a reporter to join our expanding Asia team, based in Hong Kong. We need a reporter who can deliver deeply sourced exclusives on corporate strategy, agenda-setting trend pieces as well as scoops on the mega funding rounds. Enterprise: As part of our expanded focus on enterprise technology, The Information is looking for a reporter to cover enterprise software firms, ranging from Salesforce to Oracle to Dropbox and Slack. Subscription software firms in recent years have transformed the market for business-oriented software, forcing everyone from Microsoft to Oracle to adapt. The emergence of startups focused on cloud services promises continuing change. The successful candidate will have experience covering technology, both in breaking news and in-depth features. Regulatory/Politics/Policy: Regulatory pressures have been a fact of life for big tech giants for decades, but this year has seen a political backlash against big tech. Partly that reflects the role some tech firms played in the 2016 election and partly it is due to the disruption all the companies have caused across industries. The Information is looking for reporters to cover the intersection of tech and politics. We want to get inside the tech companies’ policy teams, and stay ahead of legislative and regulatory moves affecting big tech firms. Successful candidates need experience covering Congress or regulators. Energy tech: Tech is disrupting most industries, but one of the least understood is the impact on the energy industry. For starters, there is Tesla, which is proving that investors have an enormous appetite for companies in the renewable energy business. The rise of batteries produced by Tesla will make it easier for consumers to reduce purchases of power from utilities. At the same time, smart technologies are making it possible for businesses and homes to better manage their electricity use. Nuclear startups are drawing large amounts of funding, despite uncertainty about their business models. We’re looking for a reporter with experience covering energy industries to join The Information to write about the intersection of tech and energy. Biotech/Healthcare: Big tech is remaking the biotech and healthcare industries. Alphabet has several firms investing in ways to cure disease, while the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative also is investing in biotech. Former employees of both Google and Facebook have started more than 20 new firms looking at everything from new ways to cure cancer to improving the experience of going to the doctor. We are looking for a reporter interested in covering significant science breakthroughs, the role big data is playing in developing drugs and the privacy implications of new technologies. The successful candidate will have experience breaking news and writing in-depth features, preferably in the biotech or healthcare industries. Editing: As we grow our reporting team, The Information needs more editors. We’re looking for a news editor to handle editing of both news and feature stories, overseeing the final stages of stories through to publication and helping conceptualize future stories in conjunction with reporters and other editors. Additional duties could include assisting with publication of daily and weekly newsletters. The successful candidate will have five to 10 years’ editing experience at a major news publication, preferably one covering business and the technology industry.

Our mission is to create large-scale environmental impacts for our clients by implementing market-based solutions and developing policies that contribute to these goals. We foster this mission by retaining a talented and committed team, providing a stimulating, healthy and participatory workplace, and emphasizing creative new approaches that maximize the value of our services. With over 100 staff, we are honored to serve a diverse range of utility, public agency, commercial and industrial clients. Project Description Increasing the adoption of energy efficient technologies is critical to de-carbonizing the US economy. Many new IoT (Internet of Things) technologies not only reduce and manage energy consumption but also provide significant non-energy benefits, such as improved comfort, more effective workspaces, or data insights about how a space is utilized. Leveraging the emerging business models focused on these non-energy benefits is a critical way to drive the adoption of efficient energy technologies.  Most organizations spend between 10-100x more on facilities or staff resources than on their energy bill, and so focusing on technologies that improve facility or human resource productivity is one of the fastest ways to achieve energy efficiency and emissions reduction goals. Think of the Nest Thermostat: it achieved major reductions in home energy consumption, but was primarily marketed and sold to consumers based on its non-energy benefits of improved scheduling convenience and comfort. The challenge today is that in many cases, the methods of quantifying the value of these NEBs are not well defined and require further improvement before they are widely adopted and recognized by businesses.  The goal of this project will be to conduct research on emerging areas that could dramatically change energy business models, how technologies are adopted and energy use is managed. Specific topic areas include non-energy benefits from networked lighting or HVAC controls and/or energy-applications of blockchain. Over the summer, interns will work closely with ES staff on this research project, culminating in an internal report and presentation to Energy Solutions staff. Daily responsibilities include but are not limited to:Research Identification and scheduling of resources to complete projectsTechnology research and literature searchesOrganization and facilitation of in-person meetings and conference callsMinimum Qualifications:Working towards a degree in an energy-related discipline with environmental, economics, or engineering preferred;Strong interest in market-based solutions to accelerate the adoption of energy efficient technologies into the marketStrong competency in researching complex technical, data-related topics to support policy and business decisions.Demonstrated ability to conduct detailed technical and quantitative analysisStrong technical writing and verbal communication skillsExperience using Microsoft Office, data visualization related applications such as Tableau a plusTo apply for this position, upload your resume and a cover letter with your available start date and why you are interested in this project through out website Careers page by March 30th, 2018.

We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of responsibilities. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframe.How to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at Paxos. So, we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role.OUTCOMES Build high quality and robust test automation solutions for functional and regression testing that would reduce test cycle times and increase customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is measured by ensuring quality is within defined defect density. Build and maintain CI/CD pipeline that would provide a mean to check code quality, get faster feedback and reduce defects. Success is measured by the quality of deliverables and the speed of deployment to production. Identify and proactively tackle technical debt to avoid significant work that would be needed to resolve it. Active involvement and mentorship of junior engineers by doing code reviews resulting in leveling up of skill sets for the entire team. Find, isolate (root cause analysis), document, regress, and track defects through resolution across different environments. Success is measured by reduction in defect leakage.HOW TO ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMESTechnical Acumen Required: Functional automation with Selenium in one or more languages, such as: Ruby(preferred), Python, Nodejs, JavaScript. API testing with tools such as SOAPUI, Postman, KarateDSL or REST-Assured. Proven experience in building and managing at least one test automation framework such as RSpec, Cucumber, Jasmine, Robot Framework. Experienced in Linux/Unix software, Shell or Perl scripting.

Proactively identifies problems with requirements for their own work and adjacent work, and communicate these issues early to help course-correct. Interpret and report testing results, and be a vocal proponent for quality in every phase of the development processTake Initiative: Shows initiative beyond merely knocking tasks off a list. Identifies and suggests areas of future work for themselves and their teams. Work with software development engineers to understand the overall technical architecture and how each feature is implemented. Produce output by taking a complex user story, breaking it down into acceptance criteria, and complete testing of the acceptance criteria through automated tests.Be a Force Multiplier: Have the mentality of ""Automation-First"" and guide other team members in taking the automate everything approach. Able to work independently with very little oversight beyond high-level direction. Participates extensively in code reviews, mentors others via code reviews.Respect Everyone: Able to communicate effectively across functions. The ability to get work done across teams goes beyond mere proactive status updates (although that is expected as well).

Its flagship service is BankchainTM, a next-generation blockchain settlement platform that is transforming post-trade across capital markets.

We are looking for a leader on our Talent Acquisition team. This is an opportunity to build, coach and develop a team of high performing sourcers, recruiters and recruiting coordinators. The goal is for Paxos to meet our growing, aggressive demand for talent, while keeping our hiring bar incredibly high. We are at an exciting growth stage as a well-funded, Post Series B tech company. At the same time, we are just reaching product-market fit for a complex product that will disrupt financial services using Blockchain technology. The impact of this role will be directly felt in hiring the next generation of leaders and talent that will build and grow this transformative product.We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of tasks and responsibilities. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframeHow to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at Paxos. So, we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role. Outcomes: Design and execute a strong playbook to source top talent for high volume roles that maps our high hiring bar externally. Success is measured by providing high quality talent insights to hiring managers. Partner with the Head of Talent Acquisition to create a tech-focused employment branding strategy. Success is measured by the ability to engage passive talent (those not actively job searching) for those roles. Mentor a team of recruiters and recruiting coordinators to standardize and scale our recruiting process to meet aggressive Y-O-Y growth in headcount. Success is measured by the ability create a positive candidate and hiring manager experience.Hire, coach and develop a high performing recruiting team to find and build the next generation of talent for Paxos. Success is measured by strong manager effectiveness scores from your team.How to achieve the Outcomes:Functional acumen required: Strong grasp of nuances in technical talent (Software Engineers, Product Managers, TPMs and Designers) particularly from product-driven technology companies. You are able to articulate the difference in scope and complexity between roles outside of mere titles based on a deep understanding of the product or business complexity. Strong track record of being a coach to your direct reports. You have developed giving and receiving feedback into a fine art, can empower your team to be their best and constantly thinks about whats next for them in their growth journey.Shared commitment to excellence: Strong track record of balancing the need to fill roles in a timely way with an unyielding emphasis on the hiring bar. When forced to choose, you always prioritize the hiring bar, but can still propose business-focused solutions for how to fill the role. You have a very high standard for engaging and using staffing agencies as a recruiting source. You understand that they have a role to play but do not use them as a substitute for a high performing internal recruiting team.Search for the truth: You have a strong track record of being business outcomes focused and use that to probe deep on the role, the need for the role, its scope etc. You are able to use the information from this rigorous process to inform and advise hiring managers on their staffing needs. You have a diagnostic approach to people and performance. You are very interested in causal and correlated factors that affect motivation, growth and ultimately performance of your team members rather than react to symptoms or outcomes. Be an owner You have a track record of using scalable process to hire efficiently. You also know when it makes sense to make meaningful exceptions to processes to optimize for the hiring manager or candidate experience. You do not insist on process for the sake of process. You understand that recruiting for a high bar company is incredibly difficult. That does not deter you from signing up for aggressive staffing goals because its inconvenient or trying to shield team members when they have a performance issue or need feedback/help.Real time candor: You have a strong track record of building trust with hiring managers because you tell them inconvenient truths that they need to hear and process in order to be successful. This candor is based on good data from the efficient hiring processes that you and your team have built. You are transparent in the way you operate as a manager and your team members are never surprised to hear what you think of their performance. You optimize for open channels of communication, regular 1:1s etc. to make sure that your team members have all the opportunity to tell you if they either need help, resources etc. or communicate their growth/development aspirations to you.Desired Experience: Experience managing a team of recruiters, sourcers and recruiting coordinators in a product-driven technology company is a MUST. Experience recruiting for a high bar technology organization that is known for their quality of talent is preferable. Experience recruiting for technology organizations that have a unique approach to recruiting and has helped them differentiate themselves from their competitors is a huge plus.

We are seeking a Technical Sourcer to join our Talent Acquisition team to support of the growth of Paxos and its need to aggressively hire top-tier talent. This is an opportunity to work with a team of dynamic recruiters, recruiting coordinators, and Talent professionals. We are at an exciting growth stage as a well-funded, Post Series B tech company. Paxos is at the cusp of reaching a product-market fit for a complex product that will disrupt financial services using Blockchain technology. The impact of this role will be directly felt by the next generation of leaders and talent that will build and grow this transformative product.We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of tasks and responsibilities. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframeHow to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at Paxos. So, we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role. Outcomes Continuously develop and build a strong and consistent pipeline of candidates for every role you are tasked with, with the goal of optimizing and reducing time to hire. Success is measured by the depth and quality of candidate pipeline. Build proactive relationships with passive candidates through a specific set of channels/methods in line with our branding initiatives. Success is measured by the quality of insights generated to improve our branding outreach. Constantly evaluate sourcing channel efficiency by rol. Advise our team of recruiters on when/how to refine our sourcing strategythat is critical to meet our aggressive Y-O-Y growth in headcount for the next few years. Success is measured by being able to surface useful sourcing insights resulting in a continuously strong candidate pipeline. How to achieve the OutcomesSearch for the Truth: You are really good at using the context or the why behind a project to foresee bottlenecks or issues downstream. You realize that not doing so will dilute the impact of your project and make it sub-optimal. You proactively seek to educate yourself on the business or organizational context behind any sourcing you do. You use the additional vetting to meaningfully make your work more impactful.Functional acumen required: Relevant understanding of various engineering and technologies roles (i.e. Software Engineers, DevOps, and SDET) and how it fits into different organizations and environments. Strong knowledge in sourcing technologies (LinkedIn recruiter, Angel List, GitHub, Dice.com, etc.) and diversity of sources (postings, meetups, referrals, etc.) Basic understanding of reporting templates and ability to use tools such as Google Sheets to create them.Shared commitment to excellence: Strong track record of balancing the need to fill the pipeline in a timely way with an unyielding emphasis on the hiring bar. When forced to choose, you always prioritize the hiring bar, but can still propose business-focused solutions for how to fill the role.Be an owner: Ability to quickly iterate on the right set of backgrounds and experiences for each role and then be autonomous in moving candidates through the pipeline without being a bottleneck to the recruiter. Surface hiring trends/recommend changes to sourcing strategy when appropriate You understand that sourcing for a high bar company is incredibly difficult. That does not deter you from surfacing useful hiring insights and suggesting change of sourcing strategy.Real time candor: Show the right balance of backbone and humility in pushing back on stakeholders (hiring manager, recruiters) that earns their respect for your subject matter expertise. You have a strong track record of building trust with recruiters and coordinators because you tell them inconvenient truths that they need to hear and process in order to be successful. This candor is based on good data from the efficient hiring processes that you and your team have built.Desired Experience: Experience sourcing for a high bar technology organization that is known for their quality of talent is required. Experience sourcing for technology organizations that have a unique approach to recruiting and has helped them differentiate themselves from their competitors is a huge plus.

And then we build the MVP...not a crummy version of a half-baked solution done in a few weeks but what a Minimally Viable Product is supposed to be: an experiment fully instrumented for learning to discover if what we thought people needed is what they actually want.  We work both on client projects and on innovative new ventures that ConsenSys itself the world's premier Ethereum venture development lab funds or bakes internally before spinning out into our constellation of startups. (And it is always open to you to become a founder of the next ConsenSys company...it's what we do.) Also, our developers across the world are working on the front lines of improving the Ethereum platform itself. Your insights building real-world solutions for users will have a direct impact on how the technology driving the Internet's latest transformation evolves. Here are some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society.A dynamic startup environment.

Our flagship Blockchain product, BankchainTM, has an ambitious mission to help customers digitize/tokenize any asset (equities, metals, commodities and more) and enable their movement with utmost trust and efficiency. This role will not only help shape the future of this business, but will also help set the direction for the evolution of our core BankchainTM platform itself.We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of tasks. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframe.How to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at Paxos. So, we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role. Outcomes: Use-Case Discovery: Partner with Business Development to evaluate and recommend use cases that reflects our mission of mobilizing assets and simplifying settlement by translating it into concrete products for the the Equities market. Success is measured by producing use-cases that have Product feasibility. Product-Market Fit: Lead the effort to discover and establish product-market fit for different use-cases in the Securities BankchainTM product that will significantly advance the core mission. Success is measured by iteratively building and launching product features that address customer needs. Customer Experience and Insights: Design and operationalize a framework for user testing that has the pulse of the customer throughout the product life cycle. Success is measured by surfacing actionable product insights that helps us be agile on product roadmap evolution. Product Roadmap: Own and execute a customer-centric framework to prioritize or de-prioritize aspects of the product roadmap that clearly communicates the direction of the product to both internal (engineering, business development, operations etc.) and external stakeholders. Success is measured by the ability to deliver the product roadmap with complete buy-in and alignment from stakeholders.How to achieve the Outcomes:Functional acumen required: Have a strong understanding of Product Development for Infrastructure as a Service products. Be able to easily navigate between the business and engineering aspects of building a product on top of a platform that can serve multiple use cases based on its technology. Contribute to the architecture and design efforts primarily by serving as the technically-savvy voice that asks business and product questions of the engineers on their teams, ensuring that the code matches the business needs and can scale appropriately as those needs grow.Shared commitment to excellence: Have a very high bar for the product as it impacts the end customer/client and relentlessly advocate for a infrastructural approach to solve persistent problems. Relentlessly obsess about the quality of your products impact on the customer. You constantly advocate for the best possible solution instead of taking shortcuts or accepting the most popular solution just because it's easy or quick.Search for the truth: Be able to keep your biases about the way youve built products in the past aside when making product roadmap or feature decisions. Take a first principles approach to making product decisions that is grounded in the business and mission of the company. Recognize, champion and advance creative solutions to sticky problems regardless of where or who they come from.Be an owner: You are strongly outcomes-focused and think of solving big problems in iterations. If the iteration is in service of the larger goal, you do not hesitate to try it out even if it means it isnt perfect. You have a track record of anticipating changes to the product or business and can quickly pivot to work the changes into your plan without letting it derail the business.Real time candor: Do not hesitate to voice inconvenient truths at the right time, in front of the right audience, while making product or client facing decisions. Doing so in a way that leads to a better solution is paramount, even if it is inconvenient for others in the moment. Build strong trust with cross-functional partners, particularly in engineering and the business, by disagreeing with them in an open way when required, but working in earnest to activate a decision that has been made even if it goes against what you wanted to do.Desired Experience: A strong engineering or product development background with progressive growth in role scope that has led to developing complex products is needed. Experience working in highly ambiguous and fast-paced environments such as a Product-led tech startup is desirable. Experience in influencing either the engineering architecture or product roadmap for a complex product (such as infrastructure as a service) is an advantage. Paxos is an equal opportunity employer.
