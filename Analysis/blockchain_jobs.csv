With potential progression once in post to £41,212 a year.Additional InformationTerms and ConditionsResearch and Analogous Staff (non-clinical)Job PurposeThis project seeks to identify, map and examine the implications of utilising ‘blockchain’ technology in healthcare. In so doing, it will identify the legal, ethical, technical and governance opportunities, risks and challenges in utilising blockchain technologies in healthcare, both in (1) securing compliance with regulatory goals and (2) securing the protection of fundamental values. Many commentators claim that blockchain technologies have enormous potential to address challenges associated with managing healthcare data in ways that are efficient, reliable and compatible with human rights. Yet it far from clear that blockchain technologies will live up to their promise, both generally and in healthcare contexts in particular.  As Research Fellow, the post-holder will undertake the primary technical research supporting this project and contribute towards ensuring its efficient and effective progress through to completion. A large part of the substantive work will consist of critically assessing the potential of distributed ledger (‘blockchain’) technologies in the healthcare  context. Among other things, the post-holder will undertake a multi-disciplinary review of the grey and academic literature in order to map the state of the art in blockchain technologies, protocols and applications, to identify current, proposed and developing blockchain applications in healthcare worldwide as well as specific blockchain proposals within the UK healthcare context.

Its flagship service is BankchainTM, a next-generation blockchain settlement platform that is transforming post-trade across capital markets. Paxos management team is led by CEO and Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla and its board of directors includes former FDIC chair Sheila Bair, former Senator Bill Bradley, former chair of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Robert Herz, former chairman, president & CEO of Lotus Development Corporation Jim Manzi and former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer. We pride ourselves on a very high hiring bar which is why instead of a standard job description, we think of our roles first and foremost in terms of the outcomes they are meant to achieve. So we have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections.We hope you will enjoy reading this as much as we enjoyed writing it. Outcomes: Outcomes are meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and the business over a defined timeframe. How to Achieve Outcomes: We also have a strong point of view on how someone in that role could succeed in achieving those outcomes and, eventually, at Paxos. So we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role.Outcomes Produces a work output by taking a complex user story, breaking it down into sub-tasks, and completing the sub-tasks with relative ease - own design, coding, testing all the way through deployment of each of those sub-tasks. Identifies and proactively tackles technical debt before it grows into something that requires significant up-front work to resolve. A rule of thumb is to start looking into root cause of issues whenever there is noise. There is no smoke without fire. Strike the right balance between fixing the problem at hand and focusing on finding the root cause of problem. For example, if its a production issue the priority is to fix the immediate problem and collect all the data necessary for root cause analysis. In a non-production environment, the focus should be on finding the root cause and fixing it the right way to make sure the problem doesnt occur again. Active involvement and mentorship of junior engineers doing code reviews resulting in up leveling the skill sets for the entire teamHow to Achieve the OutcomesTechnical Acumen Required: A rock solid engineer who is master of at least one domain. This could be a functional domain like Securities or Precious Metals or a technical domain like Distributed Systems, Cryptography, Databases, AWS, etc. Able to understand and articulate the design and application of the architecture of the entire systemAccountability: Communicates effectively, consistently and in a timely fashion, across functions and is able to work well with the Product, UX and Solutions teams. Proactively identifies problems with requirements (lack of clarity, inconsistencies, technical limitations) for their own work and adjacent work, and communicate these issues early to help course-correct.Take Initiative: Takes the initiative to identify and solve important problems even if they are in their domain or work area because of the ability to spot problems downstream and work with others to fix them before they become fires. Shows initiative beyond merely knocking tasks off a list. Identifies and suggests areas of future work for themselves and their teams.Be a Force Multiplier: Able to work independently with very little oversight beyond high-level direction Participates extensively in code reviews, mentors others via code reviews and pairing, document thoroughly as well as frequently presenting at team meetingsKeep it Simple and Smart: Understands the tradeoffs needed in creating good software in their area, which is often times an entire product or platform featureRespect Everyone: Able to communicate effectively across functions. The ability to get work done across teams goes beyond mere proactive status updates (although that is expected as well) Play a leadership role in making the right trade-offs with other teams even when doing so might mean more work for themselves, as long as that is the right thing to do.Paxos is an equal opportunity employer.

Our mission is to help banks become truly digital so that billions of people can get access to amazing financial services that look after them rather than benefitting from their mistakes.  Our team has co-founded and created challenger banks (Monzo, Starling, Tandem), delivered banking interfaces that millions of people use, developed real world blockchain projects, worked on APIs for financial inclusion in Africa, and we are helping banks and fintechs think differently across the world.  We aren’t an agency. We don’t work like that. We do startups rather than ‘projects’.  We’re growing, and we’re looking for talented people to join us and shape the future of Fintech, and change the world! If you want to work with an all-star team to create and deliver products and propositions at scale, we’d like to talk to you. RequirementsWhat does your day to day look like then? We are looking for skilled back end engineers to work with our product, design and operations teams to help build out our next generation banking platforms. Responsible for creating the low level platform and core banking services you will help power our web, mobile and IOT/blockchain user interfaces and clients through our REST APIs.  We know that building high performance, highly scalable, always available, fault tolerant systems is a team game and so we want to know that you play well with others. Lone geniuses are brilliant - just not for us.  We strongly believe that you grow a system, rather than build it, so our architecture and infrastructure is designed to allow us to roll small bits of code to production really fast. And really often. At a minimum we want to see that you have experience of working in cloud based, continuous deployment type environments and that you can demonstrate that you understand that with this awesome power comes a lot of responsibility to make sure you are doing things right. We are mainly interested in making sure you have the right behaviours by default but we would also love to see you have good experience of using schedulers like Kubernetes, Mesos/Marathon and containers like Docker.  Language wise, we don’t believe that there is one ring to rule them all and so we definitely want to choose the right tool for the right job. That doesn’t mean that it is a free for all and that anything goes, but we are looking for people who are comfortable with several languages and paradigms. If you speak functional AND OO then we definitely want to talk to you. Our back end services typically run either JVM (Java, Scala, Clojure) based languages, Go or something like Python/R for the analytics streams. For the front end we are React orientated and the mobile teams are native Android and IOS. The more languages and paradigms you are fluent in, the more we will probably like you!  Finally, we know you get this, but guarantee your place on the team and make yourself stand out by telling us all about all those “character building” experiences you have gained through having to live with the systems that you have built. Show us your battle scars and explain to us what operational insights and learnings you have gained by having to trouble shoot issues at some horrible time in the morning and what you put in place to make sure that particular issue didn’t bite you again. Expect us to ask about how you trouble shoot issues and demonstrate, with actions, that you understand that ops and quality assurance is EVERYONE’s job and not someone else’s’. If you build it, you will run it so do a good job!BenefitsSimple, build a banking platform which will improve the lives of millions of business people.

This person will own all business development outcomes. We are looking for a variety of candidates and have needs for flavors of this role, some more partner-relationship centric and some more direct-client centric. We are specifically looking for business development managers to support our partnership activities (primarily cloud providers and solution integrators), financial services efforts (New York and London) and industrial/corporate sales.  Our business development managers lead technical and delivery teams through complex sales processes: requirements gathering, solution architecture, product and competitive positioning, partner enablement, proposal generation and drafting appropriately scoped statements of work. You could be onstage at a conference one day, working on a client proposal the next, and delivering partner training the following week, all while collaborating with our product teams on feature roadmaps, token launches or marketing roadshows.

We think that means you will have an opportunity to create an exciting role with plenty of growth potential over time.  When we interview you, we will be looking for people with high levels of emotional intelligence who are also intellectually curious, always professional, dynamic in conversation, charismatic, and persuasive. You must be able to ask specific yet articulate questions, quickly synthesize insights from patterns in conversation, and reflect back the key points from a conversation in order to get alignment, commitments, and lay out next steps.  From a tactical standpoint, you are highly effective at leading discovery meetings, taking thorough notes, continuously qualifying opportunities in or out of the pipeline, designing and presenting bespoke sales proposals to key stakeholders, and overcoming challenges and objections to get to commitments. You must take a hands on approach throughout the contract / negotiation phase to ensure all stakeholders sign off on the engagement with agreeable terms.

At ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.  As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we’re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Developer plays an important role in leading these projects to success. Curious what makes a Lead Developer within ConsenSys? A lead is: Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery You will be excited to coach, mentor, influence and lead a team of ConsenSys employees as well as engage and advise clients. An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more (still willing and able to dive into the code if required) Owner of the technical recommendations to the client - both on technology/tool choices as well as architecture We believe that to flourish as a Lead Developer here, you have the following competencies:: Technical SkillsCore blockchain concepts. Blockchain is a new field of technology that is rapidly evolving. If you are not yet fully immersed in the technology, you should be willing to dive deep down the rabbit hole. Therefore, it would be beneficial (but not a mandatory requirement) if you already have experience or awareness of Ethereum, Solidity, Bytecode, Truffle, Infura, Geth, Parity, Quorum, or other blockchain platforms and technologies.Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical. We think that it’s important for technical leadership to continue to code. Our clients don’t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a Lead Developer, we’re looking for a breadth of experience in multiple languages, and proven expertise in one or two:  Javascript is high on our list, especially React.JS. Other notables include Python, Java, Haskell, Golang. You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.Cloud deployments. Experience building for deployments to AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, etc. using Docker would be helpful. If you're also comfortable with distributed systems and technologies, great!Consulting and delivery. Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again.Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients to great success. As well as having previous experience of managing software development teams, you should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.Soft SkillsCoaching and mentoring. As an experienced team manager, you will be naturally inclined to share knowledge with others to bring them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you’ll bring to the table, you’ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.Thinking big and acting fast. You’ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you’re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations’ tech strategies.Influencing skills & prioritisation. This goes for for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you’re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client’s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you’ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills. Managing client expectations and ensuring the team meets deadlines is critical.Subject Matter Expert. Be able to participate in a sales pitch while providing the rest of the sales team with a strong understanding of the proposed target solution.Open minded and flexible. Your role as a Lead Developer won't be set in stone, so it's vital that you enjoy change and you're willing to experience new ways of thinking and working with the ConsenSys teams. Sense of humor is a plus.And here are some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.A dynamic startup environment. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization.Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. ConsenSys is building the technology platforms that can get us to those next thresholds of scale. ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators reportA few important things to knowTravel is required. Projects may be on customer sites, so our blockchain consultants need to be flexible and up for extensive travel. Many of our consultants travel for weeks on end.

We are looking for a leader on our Talent Acquisition team. This is an opportunity to build, coach and develop a team of high performing sourcers, recruiters and recruiting coordinators. The goal is for Paxos to meet our growing, aggressive demand for talent, while keeping our hiring bar incredibly high. We are at an exciting growth stage as a well-funded, Post Series B tech company. At the same time, we are just reaching product-market fit for a complex product that will disrupt financial services using Blockchain technology. The impact of this role will be directly felt in hiring the next generation of leaders and talent that will build and grow this transformative product.We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of tasks and responsibilities. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframeHow to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at Paxos. So, we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role. Outcomes: Design and execute a strong playbook to source top talent for high volume roles that maps our high hiring bar externally. Success is measured by providing high quality talent insights to hiring managers. Partner with the Head of Talent Acquisition to create a tech-focused employment branding strategy. Success is measured by the ability to engage passive talent (those not actively job searching) for those roles. Mentor a team of recruiters and recruiting coordinators to standardize and scale our recruiting process to meet aggressive Y-O-Y growth in headcount. Success is measured by the ability create a positive candidate and hiring manager experience.Hire, coach and develop a high performing recruiting team to find and build the next generation of talent for Paxos. Success is measured by strong manager effectiveness scores from your team.How to achieve the Outcomes:Functional acumen required: Strong grasp of nuances in technical talent (Software Engineers, Product Managers, TPMs and Designers) particularly from product-driven technology companies. You are able to articulate the difference in scope and complexity between roles outside of mere titles based on a deep understanding of the product or business complexity. Strong track record of being a coach to your direct reports. You have developed giving and receiving feedback into a fine art, can empower your team to be their best and constantly thinks about whats next for them in their growth journey.Shared commitment to excellence: Strong track record of balancing the need to fill roles in a timely way with an unyielding emphasis on the hiring bar. When forced to choose, you always prioritize the hiring bar, but can still propose business-focused solutions for how to fill the role. You have a very high standard for engaging and using staffing agencies as a recruiting source. You understand that they have a role to play but do not use them as a substitute for a high performing internal recruiting team.Search for the truth: You have a strong track record of being business outcomes focused and use that to probe deep on the role, the need for the role, its scope etc. You are able to use the information from this rigorous process to inform and advise hiring managers on their staffing needs. You have a diagnostic approach to people and performance. You are very interested in causal and correlated factors that affect motivation, growth and ultimately performance of your team members rather than react to symptoms or outcomes. Be an owner You have a track record of using scalable process to hire efficiently. You also know when it makes sense to make meaningful exceptions to processes to optimize for the hiring manager or candidate experience. You do not insist on process for the sake of process. You understand that recruiting for a high bar company is incredibly difficult. That does not deter you from signing up for aggressive staffing goals because its inconvenient or trying to shield team members when they have a performance issue or need feedback/help.Real time candor: You have a strong track record of building trust with hiring managers because you tell them inconvenient truths that they need to hear and process in order to be successful. This candor is based on good data from the efficient hiring processes that you and your team have built. You are transparent in the way you operate as a manager and your team members are never surprised to hear what you think of their performance. You optimize for open channels of communication, regular 1:1s etc. to make sure that your team members have all the opportunity to tell you if they either need help, resources etc. or communicate their growth/development aspirations to you.Desired Experience: Experience managing a team of recruiters, sourcers and recruiting coordinators in a product-driven technology company is a MUST. Experience recruiting for a high bar technology organization that is known for their quality of talent is preferable. Experience recruiting for technology organizations that have a unique approach to recruiting and has helped them differentiate themselves from their competitors is a huge plus.

Its flagship service is BankchainTM, a next-generation blockchain settlement platform that is transforming post-trade across capital markets. Paxos management team is led by CEO and Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla and its board of directors includes former FDIC chair Sheila Bair, former Senator Bill Bradley, former chair of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Robert Herz, former chairman, president & CEO of Lotus Development Corporation Jim Manzi and former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer. We are seeking a Technical Sourcer to join our Talent Acquisition team to support of the growth of Paxos and its need to aggressively hire top-tier talent. This is an opportunity to work with a team of dynamic recruiters, recruiting coordinators, and Talent professionals. We are at an exciting growth stage as a well-funded, Post Series B tech company. Paxos is at the cusp of reaching a product-market fit for a complex product that will disrupt financial services using Blockchain technology. The impact of this role will be directly felt by the next generation of leaders and talent that will build and grow this transformative product.We hold ourselves to a very high hiring bar. To achieve this, we think of roles first and foremost as outcomes to be achieved, not simply a description of tasks and responsibilities. We have developed what we call a Success Profile for this role, which has two sections:Outcomes: Meaningful and measurable work products that have a significant impact on the team and business over a defined timeframeHow to Achieve Outcomes: We have a strong point of view on how this role will succeed in achieving outcomes at Paxos. So, we have taken the Operating System of Paxos - our values - and made it relevant to this role. Outcomes Continuously develop and build a strong and consistent pipeline of candidates for every role you are tasked with, with the goal of optimizing and reducing time to hire. Success is measured by the depth and quality of candidate pipeline. Build proactive relationships with passive candidates through a specific set of channels/methods in line with our branding initiatives. Success is measured by the quality of insights generated to improve our branding outreach. Constantly evaluate sourcing channel efficiency by rol. Advise our team of recruiters on when/how to refine our sourcing strategythat is critical to meet our aggressive Y-O-Y growth in headcount for the next few years. Success is measured by being able to surface useful sourcing insights resulting in a continuously strong candidate pipeline. How to achieve the OutcomesSearch for the Truth: You are really good at using the context or the why behind a project to foresee bottlenecks or issues downstream. You realize that not doing so will dilute the impact of your project and make it sub-optimal. You proactively seek to educate yourself on the business or organizational context behind any sourcing you do. You use the additional vetting to meaningfully make your work more impactful.Functional acumen required: Relevant understanding of various engineering and technologies roles (i.e. Software Engineers, DevOps, and SDET) and how it fits into different organizations and environments. Strong knowledge in sourcing technologies (LinkedIn recruiter, Angel List, GitHub, Dice.com, etc.) and diversity of sources (postings, meetups, referrals, etc.) Basic understanding of reporting templates and ability to use tools such as Google Sheets to create them.Shared commitment to excellence: Strong track record of balancing the need to fill the pipeline in a timely way with an unyielding emphasis on the hiring bar. When forced to choose, you always prioritize the hiring bar, but can still propose business-focused solutions for how to fill the role.Be an owner: Ability to quickly iterate on the right set of backgrounds and experiences for each role and then be autonomous in moving candidates through the pipeline without being a bottleneck to the recruiter. Surface hiring trends/recommend changes to sourcing strategy when appropriate You understand that sourcing for a high bar company is incredibly difficult. That does not deter you from surfacing useful hiring insights and suggesting change of sourcing strategy.Real time candor: Show the right balance of backbone and humility in pushing back on stakeholders (hiring manager, recruiters) that earns their respect for your subject matter expertise. You have a strong track record of building trust with recruiters and coordinators because you tell them inconvenient truths that they need to hear and process in order to be successful. This candor is based on good data from the efficient hiring processes that you and your team have built.Desired Experience: Experience sourcing for a high bar technology organization that is known for their quality of talent is required. Experience sourcing for technology organizations that have a unique approach to recruiting and has helped them differentiate themselves from their competitors is a huge plus. Paxos is an equal opportunity employer. It does not discriminate on the basis of sex, age, color, race religion, marital status, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation, physical and mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, veteran status or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law.

Our vision is to decentralize banking and bring the power of financial services to everyone in the world, including the nearly 2 billion adults that to this day remain unbanked.Embedded development at BreadBread's origins trace back to the desire to build a beautiful product underpinned by beautiful software. Our mobile wallet connects directly to cryptocurrency peer to peer networks and as such has a unique set of requirements that differs from those that depend on a centralized server. To accomplish this task we've built a standalone C library which provides a full bitcoin SPV wallet. Aaron Voisine, the author of the library, has painstakingly crafted this library so it can be used in both our iOS and Android wallets.  This codebase is responsible for providing access to billions of dollars in assets on customers wallets. It's paramount that we continue to maintain and evolve the library to meet our business and our customer needs. This includes adding support for more cryptocurrencies, and building a testing infrastructure so we can automatically verify correctness.What we're doing at BreadBread is at the heart of a financial revolution. We're building the missing piece of infrastructure that ties together the essential functionality of a bank, but where individuals retain complete control over their assets. As a a financial infrastructure company, our mission is unlikely to ever be complete. We need continually strive to bring the power of our apps to new regions of the world, some of which have never had wide access to banking functionality.  Our approach to this problem heavily focuses on several core tenants. For one, we will never have direct control or visibility over customer funds. It is not our job to interfere in the personal financial lives of our customers. This is accomplished by using digital assets like Bitcoin, and a mobile app like ours which manages its assets on-device.  The second tenant of our approach is to provide integration with the traditional financial system. Regardless of the currency, people still need to get paid, pay their bills, pay for goods at merchants, and send money to their family and friends. We are building infrastructure that integrates with local financial businesses that tie in with local currencies and adhere to local laws.  Finally, we need to fight for a quality consumer experience. This is why we try to retain control over every moment of our customer's interaction with our products. We relentlessly design, redesign, test, and experiment to ensure our customers have a positive, safe experience.What it's like to work hereWe've built a lively remote work culture that emphasizes regular personal interaction. At Bread, we started as a remote team and have built our workflows around it. This allows us to hire people who want to work with us, regardless of where they've decided to settle (or roam).  Work-life balance is important to everyone at Bread, and we strive to ensure everyone has enough time for family, exercise, and mental health. In our opinion, a happy and healthy team is an essential ingredient to finding creative solutions to the hard problems we're trying to solve.  We're more operationally transparent than you may be used to. The entire Bread team has access to a variety of dashboards that help our distributed team make better decisions. If you have a question that can't be answered by a dashboard or an easy query, let's see if we can fix that.  Bread is committed to building an actively inclusive work environment that makes our team an excellent home for everyone—regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.RequirementsThere are no hard requirements, so if you see something listed here that you're unsure about, please don't hesitate to ask! 5+ years of software engineering experienceConfidence working with low-level C codeAbility to write unit tests, integration testsComfortable working with threading, sockets, and cryptographyA desire to learn and grow your skillsYou value your attention to detail Nice to haves: Experience with the low level concepts in blockchainsMobile development experienceJava and JNISwift and Swift-C bindingsCrypto currency experience will help you get up to speed quickerYou should include these in your application: Resume and LinkedIn profileLinks to code samples on Github, Gitlab, etcEmail us your resume and a personal note  and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

We are currently seeking to fill the position of Junior Professional Officer, at the P2 level, for Systems Engineering with a thematic focus on digital systems development, integration, rollout and field support, based in the Market Access Programme Unit of the Policy and Programme Division of WFP Rome Headquarters, Italy. CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND As one of the global leaders in Cash-Based Transfers (CBT), in 2016 WFP delivered the largest portion of all of the cash-based transfer humanitarian assistance globally (a total of US$880 million); and scaled-up further in 2017 by delivering an estimated US$1.4 billion to beneficiaries.  To deliver CBT assistance, WFP works through partnerships with more than 70 commercial Financial Service Providers (FSPs) including banks, micro-finance institutions, mobile money operators and money transfer agents, in addition to using WFP’s own delivery platform SCOPE. Due to the magnitude of WFP’s CBT transfers, and its reliance on partnerships with external service providers for transferring funds, it is a priority for the Organization to ensure the robustness and inter-operability of its digital systems in order to ensure accountability for funds as well as to better inform programme design through digital analysis of data emanating from CBT operations.  The overarching objective of WFP’s digital systems development is to deliver better and more accountable CBT assistance while also supporting partners (including governments) to build or optimize their own systems to ensure that long-term sustainable support and social protection is available for WFP’s beneficiaries. WFP intends to “digitally know” its beneficiaries and their needs and preferences and the impact of projects and operations over time on families and local sectors (i.e. financial, markets, etc.). This knowledge will be possible only with a safe, seamless, perpetual flow of data and information between all departments, divisions, units, and teams across WFP and its partners. It will need to be enabled by the latest proven technologies, systems, and processes to gather, organize, share, analyze, and transform data into knowledge and evidence for responsible and informed programmatic decision making.  WFP is seeking the support of a JPO with skills in Computer Systems Engineering to help design, integrate and optimize aspects of WFP’s corporate digital systems used for digital transfer, payment cycle reconciliation and comprehensive data analysis. Following the systems development phase, the JPO will be involved in coordinating and supporting the rollout of new digital systems in WFP operations in the field worldwide.
